# Critter_Camera

Turn your Raspberry Pi into an excellent wildlife camera capable of night vision and of using two cameras: a standard raspicam and a usb camera. All of the code is in Python. 

Instructions for building the camera and getting the code up and running in the INSTALL_AND_README.txt file.

Additional instructions and images can be found in the wiki.

Best,

Stephen
