# Critter_Camera

Turn your Raspberry Pi into an excellent wildlife camera capable of night vision and of using two cameras: a standard raspicam and a usb camera. All of the code is in Python. 

Sure, you could buy an excellent motion sensing wildlife camera for $50, but where is the fun in that? Using Python and the Pi allows you to hone your Unix and coding skills. Doing it this way also gives you so much more control about what gets captured and when. 

Instructions for getting the code up and running in the INSTALL_AND_README.txt file, and instructions for building whole camera with pictures is in How_to_build_critter_camera.docx.

Project goals can be found in the wiki.

Best,

Stephen
